                      <p>Popularity of open source isn’t just skyrocketing in the federal government. </p>

      <p>Everyone seems to either want to publish an open source project, be a maintainer or contribute to an open source project. </p>

                      <p>This was me until the government shutdown last year. With 2 front-end devs on our team, I worked more on the design UI side while the over dev worked more on the "back of the front" stack like JavaScript, components and the like. But during the shutdown, both of the other 2 developers left our team. So I went from being on an engineering team to BEING the engineering team. I had to figure out a lot of things really quickly and security has been one of those topics. And that's really what I'm going to talk to you about today, all these security things we should be doing.</p>

      <p>Equifax had a massive data breach that exposed the personal information of millions people. It was completely preventable. This breach was caused by an open source package dependency which had an identified vulnerability that went unpatched for 2 months.</p>

                      <p>Figure out the dependencies you have and what packages those depend on. </p>

      <p>Not everyone comes in to a project at the beginning and knows exactly what’s being used. So take the time to go through the dependencies list to see what’s there.</p>

                      <p>Just stop and look at your dependencies. Familiarize and refresh yourself with what’s there. That way when you hear about a new vulnerability you might have a better reaction time when you know that your app is using certain packages.</p>

      <p>If you’re an npm user, you can execute `npm ls` to display a dependency tree.</p>

                      <p>Use `npm outdated` to check the registry to see if any  installed packages are currently outdated</p>

      <p>The more outdated a package is, the more likely it is to itself have vulnerable dependencies. </p>

      <p>So npm outdated can tell you exactly how far behind you are in dependency versions.</p>

      <p>It’s better to patch these up on your own terms instead of waiting for a vulnerability to be disclosed that you’re forced to immediately act on.</p>

                      <p>Get rid of dependencies you don’t need. As the number of dependencies increase, the risk of ending up with a vulnerable package can also increase.</p>

      <p>With the passage of time and changes in your code, it is likely that you'll stop using some packages altogether and instead add in new ones. However, developers tend not to remove old packages as they go along.</p>

      <p>Take the time to remove unused packages.</p>

                      <p>Just to recap these:</p>

      <p>CWE stands for Common Weakness Enumeration, and has to do with the vulnerability—not the instance within a product or system.</p>

      <p>CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, and has to do with the specific instance within a product or system—not the underlying flaw.</p>
      <p>Here's a great blog post that recaps these and more: <a href="https://danielmiessler.com/blog/mitre-quick-reference/">https://danielmiessler.com/blog/mitre-quick-reference/</a></p>

                      <p>Establish a policy and process to quickly roll out a security fix release of your software product once supporting frameworks or libraries needs to be updated for security reasons. Best is to think in terms of hours or a few days, not weeks or months. Most breaches we become aware of are caused by failure to update software components that are known to be vulnerable for months or even years.</p>

      <p>How quickly should we be releasing security fixes</p>

      <p>How can someone let us know if we have a security vulnerability</p>

                      <p>Continuously tracking your application’s dependencies for vulnerabilities and efficiently addressing them is no simple feat. When you can, it’s great to automate a lot of these things to remove some of the security burden.</p>

                      <p>Often when developing open source software, and especially software that relies on outside services, you’ll find that you have to manage sensitive information. While there are a large number of things that can be considered sensitive, open source developers often deal with sensitive items such as API tokens, passwords, and private keys that are required for the system to function. One thing you can do is to scan your code on commit to check for these types of items.
                          <p> Here's a blog post which details the tool we use and includes a quick setup script: <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/09/26/automated-scanning-for-sensitive-information/">https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/09/26/automated-scanning-for-sensitive-information/</a></p>

                      <p>You can add these CLI scanning applications to your tests so you can run them locally as part of your tests along with linting, accessibility testing, unit testing and anything else you might want to verify before making a pull request.</p>
